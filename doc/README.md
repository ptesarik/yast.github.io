YaST documentation
==================

YaST is the installation and configuration tool for openSUSE and the SUSE Linux
Enterprise distributions.

The YaST landing page located at [https://yast.opensuse.org/](https://yast.opensuse.org/)
provides a clear view of the whole project for both users and developers, but
with a stronger focus in the latter.

YaST is a complex project with several components and its source code is spread
over several repositories at GitHub, with each repository containing the
corresponding development documentation. In addition to that specific
documentation, this directory contains some documents targeted to developers and
related to the project as a whole. All the documentation is referenced from the
already mentioned YaST landing page at
[https://yast.opensuse.org/](https://yast.opensuse.org/), which aggregates
links to several sources of information (including the different files in this
directory) in a way that makes sense and is easy to digest for newcomers.
