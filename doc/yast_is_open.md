YaST is Open
============

YaST is an open source project, the source code is covered by open source
licenses (usually GPL or LGPL).

But the license is just a small part of a real open source project. What can
actually YaST offer to the community? Here is the summary:

- [The YaST portal](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:YaST) at openSUSE Wiki - the
  perfect starting point for users, with lots of information and documentation.

- [The YaST home page](http://yast.github.io/) - the starting point for YaST
  developers and contributors.

- Open development - the source code repositories are hosted at
  [GitHub](https://github.com/yast), everybody can see our work, everybody can
  fork a repository and contribute back.

- Open environment - the YaST development requires only open and free software.
  We build YaST using free libraries, tools and frameworks. We converted the
  YaST code from our specific YCP programming language to Ruby which is a widely
  used general scripting language with a large set of tools around.

- Open communication - we have a public mailing list
  (yast-devel(at)opensuse.org, with on-line
  [archive](http://lists.opensuse.org/yast-devel)), we use a public IRC channel
  ([#yast at irc.libera.chat](https://web.libera.chat/#yast)).

- [The developer's documentation](http://yastgithubio.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
  and a [tutorial](https://ancorgs.github.io/yast-journalctl-tutorial/) describing
  step-by-step how to create a new YaST module from scratch for easy start with
  YaST development.

- Open [bug](https://bugzilla.suse.com) and
  [feature](https://fate.opensuse.org) tracking for reporting errors and
  suggesting improvements.

- Public [Continuous Integration service](https://ci.opensuse.org/view/Yast/)
  (a [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) instance) for testing the latest code.

- The latest bleeding edge YaST RPM packages built from Git sources are
  available in [YaST:Head](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/YaST:Head)
  OBS project for testing, experimenting and reporting bugs.
